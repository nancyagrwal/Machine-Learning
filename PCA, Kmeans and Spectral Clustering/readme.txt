1) For Q4:
Run the file: python Q4.py
The output consists of the following:
    1) The output of the PCA is the basis of the low-dimensional subspace U, the
	mean of the subspace mu and the low-dimensional representations X. 
    2) For KPCA, output is the low-dimensional representations X. 
    3) 2 files are generated with the names 2Ddataset1.mat and 2Ddataset2.mat which contains the reduced 
       dimensional matrices for datset1 and dataset2.
    4) 6 graphs: Graphs 1 and 2 correspond to Q7 partA i) and ii)
                 Graphs 3 corresponds to Q7 partA iii)
                 Graphs 4 and 5 correspond to Q7 partB i) and ii)
                 Graphs 6 corresponds to Q7 partB iii)
	    
2) For Q5:
Run the file: python Q5.py
The output consists of the following:
    1) Indices of points in each cluster/group
    2) 6 graphs: Graphs 1 and 2 correspond to Q7 PartA iv)
                 Graphs 3 and 4 correspond to Q7 PartA v)    
                 Graphs 5 and 6 correspond to Q7 PartB iv)
    
3) For Q6:
Run the file: python Q6.py
The output consists of the following:
    1) Indices of points in each cluster/group
    2) 8 graphs: Graphs 1,2,3 and 4 correspond to Q7 PartB v)
                 Graphs 5,6,7 and 8 correspond to Q7 PartB vi)
